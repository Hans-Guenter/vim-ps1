ps1.vim
=======

If you are a regular Windows PowerShell user, and also someone who uses Vim or Gvim
for editing scripts, then this plugin is for you.

It provides nice simple syntax coloring and indenting for Windows PowerShell (.ps1)
files, and also includes a filetype plugin so Vim can autodetect your PS1 scripts.
